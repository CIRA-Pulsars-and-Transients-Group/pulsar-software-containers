# pulsar-software-containers
A simple repo containing some basic Dockerfile builds for various combinations of pulsar software that may come in handy for people processing on HPC systems.

Note that it is currently optimised for zen3 CPU architectures (`-march=znver3`) which you may want to change depending on the architecture(s) available on your desired systems.
